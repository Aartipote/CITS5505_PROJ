        <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
        <p>
            Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory infections. These can range from the common cold to more serious diseases.
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new form of coronavirus. It was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City in China.
        </p>
        <h4>How it spreads?</h4>
        <p>The virus can spread from person to person through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>close contact with an infectious person (including in the 48 hours before they had symptoms)</li>
            <li>contact with droplets from an infected personâ€™s cough or sneeze</li>
            <li>touching objects or surfaces (like doorknobs or tables) that have droplets from an infected person, and then touching your mouth or face.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            COVID-19 is a new disease, so there is no existing immunity in our community. This means that COVID-19 could spread widely and quickly.
        </p>
        <h2>Who is at most risk?</h2>
        <p>You are at high risk of the serious illness from COVID-19 if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>are 70 years or above.</li>
            <li>had an organ transplant and in immune suppresive therapy.</li>
            <li>have had a bone marrow transplant in last 24 months.</li>
